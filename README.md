# MurkyQuest
My small, GameMaker Studio based game around Blizzard's Murky murloc character from World of Warcraft/Heroes of the Storm.
Phil Levine is co-authoring this project.

Controls:
	A 		- Move Left
	D 		- Move Right
	Space 	- Jump
	T       - Murloc Noises

Goals:
	A brief, proof of concept platformer for portfolio use. Meaningful contributions give users the right to include
	this game in their portfolio. Because it is inpsired by a Blizzard IP it may only be used for strictly educational
	purposes. If you wish to continue working outside of the scope of this project you may swap the Blizzard inspired
	assets and do something else.
